## 1. Purpose

The ELECHOUSE online test feature is used to verify the network path of an RFID/NFC reader:

- The web test page generates a one-time `session_code`.
- The device opens a plain TCP socket to the ELECHOUSE Broker.
- After the TCP connection is established, the device sends `HELLO <session_code> <device_id>`.
- The Broker binds the device TCP connection to the web session by `session_code`.
- LF/HF card read events are uploaded to the web page in real time.
- The web page can send firmware commands back through the same TCP socket.

The device does not need HTTP, HTTPS, or WebSocket support. The current firmware has a built-in `ELECHOUSE Test` mode. The user only needs to enter the `session_code` assigned by the web page.

---

## 2. Fixed Connection Parameters

In `ELECHOUSE Test` mode, these parameters are fixed in firmware and do not need user configuration:

```text
TCP Host: www.elechouse.com
TCP Port: 9000
Protocol: plain TCP
Encoding: ASCII / UTF-8 text lines
Line ending: \n or \r\n
```

The firmware still supports normal TCP `Client` and `Server` modes. Only `ELECHOUSE Test` mode forces the fixed server address above.

---

## 3. session_code Rules

The `session_code` is assigned dynamically by the web test page. It is not a fixed value. The old code may become invalid when the web page is refreshed, closed, expired, or regenerated.

Allowed characters in the current firmware:

```text
A-Z a-z 0-9 _ . : -
```

Maximum length:

```text
64 characters
```

When `ELECHOUSE Test` is selected on the configuration page, `ELECHOUSE code` is required and must match the character rules above.

---

## 4. Handshake Protocol

After the TCP connection is established, the firmware automatically sends:

```text
HELLO <session_code> <device_id>\n
```

The current firmware uses this `device_id` format:

```text
ELECHOUSE_RFID-<WiFi MAC>
```

Example:

```text
HELLO EKQWQ4XZ ELECHOUSE_RFID-68:EE:8F:DD:ED:04
```

If the handshake succeeds, the Broker replies:

```text
OK <session_code>
```

Firmware serial log example:

```text
ELECHOUSE broker OK EKQWQ4XZ
```

If the handshake fails, the Broker replies:

```text
ERR <reason>
```

After receiving `ERR`, the firmware closes the TCP connection and keeps retrying with the current `session_code` according to the reconnect interval.

Common errors:

```text
ERR hello_timeout
ERR hello_format_must_be_HELLO_CODE
ERR invalid_code
ERR unknown_or_expired_code
ERR code_already_has_device
ERR hello_too_large
```

`ERR unknown_or_expired_code` usually means the web session has expired, does not exist, was refreshed, or the device is still using an old `session_code`. Generate a new code on the web page, then update the device through the web configuration page or command line.

---

## 5. Card Data Upload

After the handshake succeeds, the current firmware uploads card events as JSON Lines. Each JSON object is followed by `\n`.

Format:

```json
{"type":"card","band":"HF","card_type":"ISO14443A","uid":"1C 2C FB 10","ms":1002132}
```

Field description:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `type` | Fixed to `card` |
| `band` | `LF` or `HF` |
| `card_type` | Card type, such as `ISO14443A`, `EM4100`, or `HIDProx` |
| `uid` | UID or decoded card ID string |
| `ms` | Device `millis()` timestamp since boot |

Note: USB CDC, product UART, and normal TCP modes may use the firmware's general output format. In `ELECHOUSE Test` mode, data uploaded to the Broker always uses the JSON Lines format above.

---

## 6. Commands Sent Back From the Web Page

After the handshake succeeds, the web test page can send one text command line to the device through the Broker. The current firmware parses these lines with its existing command system.

Examples:

```text
status
wifi status
tcp status
elechouse status
test
```

The firmware separates commands by line ending. Commands sent from the web page should end with `\n`.

In `ELECHOUSE Test` mode, the firmware handles Broker control lines internally:

- `PONG` or `OK ...`: handled internally and not executed as a firmware command.
- `PING`: replies with `PONG\n`.
- Other text lines: if `TCP commands` is enabled, the line is passed to the firmware command parser.

---

## 7. Heartbeat and Reconnect

After the Broker handshake succeeds, the firmware sends this heartbeat every 20 seconds:

```text
PING
```

The Broker may reply:

```text
PONG
```

If the TCP connection is closed, the firmware reconnects according to the `TCP reconnect ms` parameter. The minimum effective reconnect interval is 1000 ms. If the web session has expired, the device will keep receiving `ERR unknown_or_expired_code` while retrying with the old code. Update the device with a new `session_code`.

---

## 8. Web Configuration

1. On first boot, or when WiFi connection fails, the device starts a configuration hotspot.
2. Join the device hotspot and open:

```text
http://10.10.10.10/
```

3. Enter the router SSID and password in the `WiFi` section.
4. Configure the `TCP Socket` section:

| Item | Setting |
|---|---|
| `Mode` | `ELECHOUSE Test` |
| `ELECHOUSE code` | `session_code` assigned by the web test page |
| `TCP events` | Recommended on |
| `TCP commands` | Enable if commands need to be sent from the web page |

5. Click `Save`. The current firmware saves the configuration and reboots automatically.
6. After reboot, the device connects to the router first. After the station connection succeeds, the configuration hotspot is turned off.
7. In `ELECHOUSE Test` mode, the device automatically connects to `www.elechouse.com:9000` and performs the handshake.

The web configuration status area shows the station IP as `STA IP`. The router hostname displayed for the device is:

```text
ELECHOUSE_RFID
```

---

## 9. Command-Line Configuration

Command inputs:

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| USB CDC | `115200 8N1`, commonly used for development and testing |
| Product UART | GPIO44/GPIO43, available in UART interface mode |
| TCP Server | Remote configuration in normal TCP server mode |
| ELECHOUSE Broker | After a successful ELECHOUSE Test handshake, commands can be sent from the web page |

### 9.1 Configure WiFi

```text
wifi <ssid> <password>
save
reboot
```

Example:

```text
wifi YOU B20150127
save
reboot
```

Check WiFi status:

```text
wifi status
```

Successful example:

```text
wifi ssid=YOU passLen=9 hostname=ELECHOUSE_RFID status=CONNECTED(3) ip=192.168.124.18
```

### 9.2 Enable ELECHOUSE Test

Runtime test only, without saving:

```text
elechouse on <session_code>
```

Example:

```text
elechouse on EKQWQ4XZ
```

Equivalent command:

```text
tcp elechouse <session_code>
```

Successful handshake example:

```text
OK elechouse test on
ELECHOUSE broker OK EKQWQ4XZ
```

Check status:

```text
elechouse status
tcp status
```

Successful status example:

```text
elechouse host=www.elechouse.com port=9000 session=EKQWQ4XZ mode=elechouse connected=yes brokerOk=yes
tcp mode=elechouse host=www.elechouse.com port=9000 listen=9000 echo=on commands=on session=EKQWQ4XZ connected=yes brokerOk=yes
```

### 9.3 Save for Automatic Connection After Reboot

After confirming the connection works:

```text
save
reboot
```

### 9.4 Update or Clear session_code

Update only the code without immediately switching TCP mode:

```text
elechouse code <session_code>
```

Clear the saved code:

```text
elechouse code clear
save
```

Turn off `ELECHOUSE Test`:

```text
elechouse off
```

Force reconnect:

```text
elechouse reconnect
```

## 10. Current Firmware Commands

### 10.1 TCP / ELECHOUSE

```text
tcp status
tcp client <host> <port>
tcp server <port>
tcp elechouse <session_code>
tcp off
tcp echo on|off
tcp commands on|off

elechouse status
elechouse code <session_code>
elechouse code clear
elechouse on [session_code]
elechouse off
elechouse reconnect
```

### 10.2 WiFi / Configuration Portal

```text
wifi <ssid> <password>
wifi status
wifi scan [ssid]
wifi reconnect
wifi off

portal status
portal on
portal off
portal ssid <ssid> [password]
```

### 10.3 Common Reader Commands

```text
status
pins
test
format json
format line
dedupe <ms>
window <lf_ms> <hf_ms>
save
load
clear
reboot
```

`test` outputs one test card event and triggers the buzzer and success LED feedback. It can be used to verify USB serial, TCP, product interface, and web test paths.

## 11. Production Test Flow

1. Open the web test page:

```text
https://www.elechouse.com/rfid-tcp-broker/
```

2. Get the `session_code` assigned by the web page.
3. Enter this command through USB CDC or the configuration page:

```text
elechouse on <session_code>
```

4. Wait for this serial log:

```text
ELECHOUSE broker OK <session_code>
```

5. Read an HF or LF card. The web page should show data similar to:

```json
{"type":"card","band":"HF","card_type":"ISO14443A","uid":"1C 2C FB 10","ms":1002132}
```

6. Send this command from the web command box:

```text
status
```

The device should return status text through TCP.

7. To make the device connect automatically after reboot:

```text
save
reboot
```

8. To remove the web session after production testing:

```text
elechouse code clear
save
```

## 12. Troubleshooting

### 12.1 Device Stays in Hotspot Mode and Does Not Join the Router

Check WiFi status:

```text
wifi status
```

Verify:

- `ssid` is correct.
- `passLen` matches the real password length.
- `hostname` is `ELECHOUSE_RFID`.
- `status` is `CONNECTED(3)`.
- The router supports 2.4 GHz WiFi.

After correcting WiFi settings:

```text
wifi <ssid> <password>
save
reboot
```

After the device connects to the router successfully, the configuration hotspot is turned off. If the router connection fails, the `10.10.10.10` configuration portal remains available.

### 12.2 `ERR unknown_or_expired_code`

Typical causes:

- The web test page was refreshed and generated a new code.
- The session expired.
- The device is still reconnecting with an old code.
- The code entered on the device does not match the web page.

Fix:

```text
elechouse on <new_session_code>
```

If it should be saved:

```text
save
```

### 12.3 `code_already_has_device`

The same `session_code` is already bound to another device. Disconnect the other device, or generate a new code on the web page.

### 12.4 `connected=yes` but `brokerOk=no`

TCP is connected to the Broker, but the HELLO handshake has not succeeded. Check:

- Whether `session` is empty.
- Whether the `session_code` is expired.
- Whether the Broker returned `ERR ...`.

### 12.5 No Card Data on the Web Page

Check:

```text
elechouse status
tcp status
```

Required state:

```text
mode=elechouse
connected=yes
brokerOk=yes
echo=on
```

The firmware also has duplicate-card suppression. The same card may not upload repeatedly within the `dedupe` time window. Adjust it if needed:

```text
dedupe <ms>
save
```

## 13. Firmware Implementation Notes

Current ELECHOUSE Test behavior:

- TCP host and port are fixed to `www.elechouse.com:9000`.
- The user only enters the web-assigned `session_code`.
- `session_code` is saved to ESP32 NVS with key `ehCode`.
- Enabling this mode automatically turns on `TCP events` and `TCP commands`.
- After TCP connection succeeds, the firmware sends `HELLO <session_code> <device_id>`.
- After the Broker replies `OK ...`, status shows `brokerOk=yes`.
- Card events are uploaded as JSON Lines.
- The firmware sends `PING` every 20 seconds.
- The firmware replies `PONG` when receiving Broker `PING`.
- Receiving `ERR ...` closes the socket and retries according to the reconnect interval.
- Normal text lines sent from the web page are passed to the unified firmware command parser.

---

## 14. Minimal Verification Commands

```text
wifi status
elechouse on EKQWQ4XZ
elechouse status
tcp status
test
```

Expected result:

```text
wifi ... status=CONNECTED(3) ip=...
ELECHOUSE broker OK EKQWQ4XZ
session=EKQWQ4XZ mode=elechouse connected=yes brokerOk=yes
```

The web page should show a test card event or a real card read event.
